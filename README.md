# SFPtranscriptome
Codes used for the publication 'Transcriptomic identification of seminal fluid proteins in a simultaneously hermaphroditic snails species'


### 
In this project, there are three parts: 
  1. determine the full sequence of known SFP genes
  2. Compare the transcriptome of PG and AG (Experiment 1)
  3. Compare the PG-specific transcripts of snails reared in different mating conditions (Experiment 2)
